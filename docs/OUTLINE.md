# Current Work
- [ ] Implement motion detection
- [ ] Implement GoPro triggering
- [ ] Find long-lasting power solution
- [ ] Build enclosure

## Motion detection
Currently, we are deciding among the following methods:
   ### PIR Sensor
   Initially seemed to give false triggers. Now being tested.
   ### Camera Vision
   This is computationally expensive / I don't know how to implement cheaply.
   ### Ultrasonic Sensor
   Initial method, however, it has a too limited view frustrum.
