# Current Work
- [ ] Implement motion detection
- [ ] Implement GoPro triggering
- [ ] Find long-lasting power solution
- [ ] Build enclosure

## Motion detection
Currently, we are deciding among the following methods:
   ### PIR Sensor
   On testing, this gives the most false triggers.
   ### Camera Vision
   This is computationally expensive / we don't know how to implement cheaply.
   ### Ultrasonic Sensor
   This is the current method in progress.
