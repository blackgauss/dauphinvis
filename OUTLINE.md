- [ ] Find long-lasting power solution
- [ ] Build enclosure

+ Motion detection
Currently, we are deciding among the following methods:
    + PIR Sensor
        On testing, this gives the most false triggers.
    + Ultrasonic Sensor
        This is the current method in progress.
    + Camera Vision
        This is computational expensive / we don't know how to implement cheaply.
